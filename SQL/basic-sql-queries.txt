/The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order/
SELECT * FROM <table> ORDER BY <Country>;


/The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword./
SELECT * FROM <table> ORDER BY <Country> DESC;

/*In simple words, we can say that SELECT UNIQUE statement is used to retrieve a unique or distinct element from the table.

/it is very useful to count the number of rows in a table having enormous data/
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM <Name of table>;  

	
/The SQL SELECT TOP Statement is used to select top data from a table/
SELECT TOP 2 * FROM <name of table>;
/*If you update multiple ROWS using WHERE clause*/
Update <Table name> SET <Column name>='Value' where Column name in (values, values);
